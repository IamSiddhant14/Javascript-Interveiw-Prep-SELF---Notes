//Node has given us an enviroment through which we are able to run javascript code in our system itself

//Before node this was not possible as we were able to run javascript on the browser side only

//Therefore node has provided us with this run time enviroment to run js on our systems also

// The nodejs runtime enviroment does not understang the DOM manipulation when running the file only in the system itself instead of rendering it on the browser

//Printing in javascript

console.log( "Hello World");
 
//variables in javascript
// There are three variables in  which are javascript var , let ,const .
//Javascript is a dyancmically typed language that is we dont to define type while declaring a variable

var a ="hello a";

var a = "hello A"

// var b = "hello";
console.log(a);

//THis let variable has value which is subject to each iteration in a for loop or a while loop (Blocked Scope)
// let a = 1;
//let a = 4; //This is not allowed for let

let b ;
b = "hello b" ;

console.log(b);

//const Here in this we store const data
//not allowed
// const c = 2;
// c = 3;
// const d;
// d= 4; //We need to define the value at the time of declare it.

const c = "hello c";
console.log(c);
